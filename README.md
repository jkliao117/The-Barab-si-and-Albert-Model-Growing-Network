# The-Barab-si-and-Albert-Model-Growing-Network
Computational coursework I completed for the Complexity and Network module

## Abstract
The objective of this project is to study the behaviour and dynamics of a scale-free, growing net- work described by the Barabási and Albert (BA) Model proposed in 1999. The BA model is established upon two key mechanisms: growth and linear preferential attachment, which collab- oratively lead to the "rich-gets-richer" effect, the scale-free power laws, and the existence of hubs. In this report, three distinct methods of attachment: pure preferential attachment (PPA), pure random attachment (PRA), and a mixture of both PPA and PRA for the existing vertices model, are programmed and studied. The degree probability distribution p(k) and the largest degree k1 are measured and compared to the corresponding theoretical predictions for all three cases to en- able further discussions on the observations, evaluations, and explanations regarding the BA model networks. The general frameworks for finite size scaling and data collapse are applied for the numerical anaysis on scale-free properties of the degree k.

## Content
The code for the BA model algorithm is in “network.py” The data can be generated in file with name indicating the task: 2 PPA files, 2 PRA files, 1 EVM file, 1 for testing the program, and one for comparing all methods The graphs included in the report are in png files in the “graphs” folder. The result of each task can be directly obtained by running the “task.py” files in any python console.
